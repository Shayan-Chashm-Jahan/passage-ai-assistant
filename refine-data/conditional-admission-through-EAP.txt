Applicants from eligible countries† who do not meet George Brown's English language entry requirements may be offered a conditional acceptance for College diploma, postgraduate and degree programs which will be subject to successful completion of level 8 or 9 of George Brown's English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program. 

† For applicants from some countries (e.g., countries where English is the first/official language and countries in South Asia) we are not able to provide the option of a Letter of Acceptance to the George Brown College English for Academic Purposes Program (EAP) as it has been our experience that Study Permit applicants from specific countries are rejected by the Canadian visa office for a Study Permit (visa) when there is an ESL (English as a Second Language) component requested. For applicants from South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) it is highly recommended to submit official TOEFL or IELTS scores.
