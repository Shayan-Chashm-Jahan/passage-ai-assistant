A crucial role in the software/system development life cycle, the business analyst gathers business requirements from various areas in the organization, and translates them into functional system design specifications that can be successfully executed by IT development teams. The role of the business analyst or information technology consultant is often critical to increasing project success rates.Full DescriptionThe Information Systems Business Analysis graduate certificate program at George Brown College is designed to meet the urgent need for professionals who can be the key liaison between business and information technology functions within an organization.
