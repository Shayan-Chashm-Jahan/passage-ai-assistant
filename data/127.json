Our three-year Construction Engineering Technology advanced diploma program will provide you with the technical, business and interpersonal skills required to effectively manage construction projects of varying sizes and complexity, emphasizing sustainable construction practices.Full DescriptionStudents in this program will gain an in-depth knowledge of the construction industry including:methods and materials of constructionconstruction estimatingconstruction law, contracts and biddingproject management and control\u00a0construction graphics and detailing\u00a0This program shares the first four semesters with the Construction Engineering Technician program. Semesters 5 & 6 prepare you for a wider range of career options in the construction sector. This three-year program equips you for positions with higher levels of responsibility and accountability in such areas as construction planning, project management, site superintendant, estimating, budget and bid preparation, sustainable building science and engineering studies.*If you enrol in the program in January, you are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year in order to continue into semester 3 in the fall.Your Field Education OptionsPlease contact the Angelo DelZotto School of Construction Management for updated information regarding field education and experiential learning options.It is anticipated that a co-op stream following semester four will be offered with selective entry, check with Angelo DelZotto School of Construction for more details.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesIndustryConstruction is the engine that drives the GTA and Ontario economies. In 2019, the industry generated over 360,000 on-site and off-site jobs, paid more than $22 billion in wages and created almost $43 billion in Ontario\u2019s built environment. Nationally, the construction industry employs one out of every 14 working Canadians. However, there remains a shortage of educated and highly skilled workers in the sector.With an expanding regional transit network stimulating redevelopment and growth and population and demographic shifts at the heart of a demand surge for housing, the GTA has the largest construction activity of any region in Canada. In fact, the City of Toronto continues to report the highest number of construction cranes of any city in North America.Despite the recent challenges, the construction sector in Ontario remains strong, led by significant government investment and continued demand for housing.The School of Construction Management Program Advisory Committee (PAC) has an engaged committee with a good and broad representation of the industry. Members contribute their ideas and opinions with respect to curriculum changes, industry trends, awards and scholarships, competitions, special events, work experience and mentoring for students.Educational PathwaysPathways to the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program are also available after completing the three-year Construction Engineering Technology program. Minimum of 3.0 GPA required.\u00a0For more information, see Transfer Guide. ",
