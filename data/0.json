    "program description": "Program Description Leadership ClaimsThe Applied A.I. Solutions Development program is one of the first of its kind to be offered by a Canadian college. Developed by George Brown College's School of Computer Technology, it recognizes the industry demand for full stack data scientists who are qualified to fill the roles of data scientist, data analyst, data engineer or machine learning engineer as needed, and also apply business analysis skills to effectively communicate how artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning can be used in business models.Program OverviewThis exciting new program instills you with knowledge that spans the fields of computer science, mathematics and business to prepare you to deliver innovative artificial intelligence (A.I.), machine learning, deep learning and data science/data analytics solutions for an ever-expanding range of industry applications.The program will focus on combining the three disciplines (computer science, math, business) with a design-thinking approach to produce machine-learning/deep-learning models and intuitive dashboards to communicate results and findings. As a student in this program, you are also given preparatory training and simulated experiences in tailoring their presentations to various target audiences including technical, business and investors.Full DescriptionAs we advance further into this increasingly digital world, artificial intelligence and data science will revolutionize most industries by optimizing business processes and automating decision-making in many white-collar jobs. As a student in the Applied A.I. Solutions Development program, you will gain the skills needed to provide existing businesses and emerging startups with the tools required to thrive in the digital revolution.This three-semester graduate certificate program uses a hands-on, applied approach to the field of A.I., giving you the broad range of skills needed to excel in this rapidly growing industry.It teaches the development and application of machine-learning/deep-learning models and provides a fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematical algorithms that power them. This combination of knowledge and skills will allow you to identify and select appropriate algorithms for a given use, build and fine-tune models and visualize and effectively communicate the resulting data, thereby bridging the traditional roles of data scientist, machine-learning engineer and business translator.Technology RequirementsThis program requires students to have access to a personal computer with the following specifications:\u00a08 GB minimum (16 GB RAM recommended0\u00a0256 GB SSD Hard Drive (500+ GB is optimal)\u00a0Quad-core i5/i7 2.4GHz or better\u00a0WebcamYour Field Education OptionsIn semester 3, students complete a Work Integrated Project, or qualified students are eligible for co-op.
