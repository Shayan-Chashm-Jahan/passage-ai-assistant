    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.The Automation Technician Certificate was developed to meet the industry's growing demand for workers with a broad set of skills and knowledge in industrial automation, including digital electronics, process control, SCADA systems and programming of Programmable Logic Controllers and robotics. The program examines applications and examples of automated manufacturing systems including both the theory and function of digital and industrial electronics, hydraulics and pneumatics, robotics systems, programming languages and alarm management. This online program is delivered to students using a combination of theory and laboratory simulations using LogixSim, a simulation software suite that includes electronics, PLC and robotics simulation.Full DescriptionINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.The Automation Technician program provides an introduction to industrial automation including digital electronics, process control, SCADA systems and programming of PLCs and robotics. The program examines applications and examples of automated manufacturing systems including both the theory and function of digital and industrial electronics, hydraulics and pneumatics, robotics systems, programming languages and alarm management.The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format, include 18 modules of interactive curriculum using text, 2D and 3D animations, photos, audio clips and interactive lab simulations. Interactive exercises, practice exams and online support prepare you for computer-based final exams. The flexible computer-based modules are designed to fit into your schedule, not ours, so you can work at your own pace to complete the program. The average completion time of the 18 training modules is 32 weeks, but there are no time limits.One of the main features of the Automation Technician program is the integration of theory with laboratory projects. Students who enrol in the program receive a licensed copy of LogixSim, which includes both 2D and 3D simulation software and features CircuitLogix Pro, RoboLogix, PLCLogix 5000 and 3DLab simulation products.LogixSim is a suite of software products that provides \u201creal world\u201d laboratory simulation of electricity, electronics, robotics and programmable logic controllers. It combines four simulators in one and allows for the design, testing and debugging of control devices and automated equipment as well as circuit schematics and systems. From the simplest control circuits to the most complex, LogixSim has the versatility to suit almost any requirement for real-world simulation.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThe program prepares you for career opportunities in the field of industrial automation and control. Automation Technicians design, install and maintain equipment and work on a wide range of systems from simple fuses, motor drives, PLCs, solid-state devices and robotics.Educational PathwaysUpon completion of the Automation Technician Certificate program, students may continue their studies and pursue a Certificate in Electromechanics (www.emcourse.com), PLCs (www.plctechnician.com) or Robotics (www.onlinerobotics.com).
