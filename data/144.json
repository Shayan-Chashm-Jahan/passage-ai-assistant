    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewGood design and technical solutions are necessary to better the world as we move forward in an ever-changing natural and built environment.Architectural technologists are key members of a project team and play a vital role in turning conceptual design ideas into technical construction documents and practical, buildable and environmentally conscious solutions. This three-year program provides you with the essential knowledge base and fundamental skills required to work as an architectural technologist within the many companies and sectors of the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Performing tasks of a technical nature, you will be part of a team of professionals and tradespeople involved in the building design, construction and management process of the built environment.Full DescriptionLearning in interactive studios with the most current equipment and software, you will develop a solid foundation of diverse and practical skills required to be involved in projects ranging from new construction to alterations and renovations in the residential, commercial, industrial and high-rise sectors of the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. The Architectural Technology program prepares you to apply current practices of the AEC industry, including:building designenvironmentally conscious and sustainable designmaterials, methods and componentssustainabilitybuilding codes and regulationsbuilding sciencepractice managementtechnical writingspecificationscost planningdigital project deliverydigital technologiescomputational designIn addition to a robust knowledge base and technical understanding of how buildings are designed and fabricated, you will also develop and apply the technical skills in the use of the digital tools, platforms and processes used by the industry and profession, such as Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD), Digital Project Delivery (DPD), Building Information Modeling (BIM) and 3D Visualization and Digital Modelling. In your project-specific Studio courses, where all knowledge and skills are applied to one large-scale project, you will practice one of the most important skills industry leaders are looking for; the ability to collaborate. In Studios, students work in teams within a simulated office environment to complete projects involving proposals, designs and construction documents for both new and existing facilities.Note: If you enrol in the program in January, you are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year to continue into semester 3 in the fall.Your Field Education OptionsUpon completion of 4th semester, a Co-operative (co-op) Work Placement experience component in the Architectural Technology program is available for a selected number of students. The intake for this co-op program is limited, and all applicants must meet program criteria, will participate in a competitive process and final approval by the School of Architectural Studies academic department.Those who enter the program will complete semester 5 from May to August, and co-op placement will take place from September to December. The sixth and final semester will be offered through a blend of in-class and online studies, allowing students to graduate in April of their final year of study. It will also allow students the opportunity to continue part-time work while completing their final semester of studies.More details are available through the department and all interested students can attend a co-op information session in early December.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsOpportunities for architectural technologists vary within the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Career options available to graduates of this program may include, but are not limited to, the following:architectural technologistarchitectural assistanttechnologist within an engineering and/or construction form/companyself-employed designer and/or contractorproject director/coordinatorjob captainmunicipal plans examinerbuilding inspectorarchitectural document productionspecification writerproperty developerproperty managerarchitectural technologist with builders/developerssite supervisortechnical representative for building/equipment suppliersFuture Study OptionsEligible graduates of the School of Architectural Studies (SAS) Architectural Technology program have the opportunity to continue in an architectural-specific academic career and apply course credits completed at George Brown College (GBC) to earn a Master of Architecture Degree with either Boston Architectural College (BAC) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. or The College of Architecture and Design (CoAD) at Lawrence Technological University (LTU) in Southfield, Michigan, USA.
