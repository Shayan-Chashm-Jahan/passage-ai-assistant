Visit the AWCCA (Accelerated) (C147) program page for more details. \u00a0\u00a0Police Vulnerable Sector Check Please note that some of our student placement partners require students in this program to have a Police Vulnerable Sector Check completed before their field placement.These Police Vulnerable Sector Checks, which can take up to four months, are done to protect the clientele of these agencies, who are considered \u201cvulnerable persons\u201d under the law.The fees for the Police Vulnerable Sector Checks vary and must be paid by the student.Students are responsible for ensuring that the check covers appropriateness for \u201cindividuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).\u201d Students who are unable to provide a clear Police Vulnerable Sector Check may find that their choice of placements is limited.Your Field Education OptionsField education plays an important role in George Brown's AWCCA program by preparing students to work with those affected by gender-based violence. It includes those directly impacted, and the communities within which they live and work and often encompasses those who identify as trans and non-binary, and other disenfranchised populations.In year one, AWCCA students take a class called Preparation for the Field, which includes introductory activities to the field, such as:interviewing staff during an agency visitconducting research to indentify placement options that will meet their learning goalsparticipating in professional development activities\u00a0learning about how programs and services are developedIn second year, AWCCA students will build on their learning by engaging in 400-hour unpaid field placement, where they will participate in many of the following:crisis interventionsupportive counselling and accompanimentgroup facilitationcase management and advocacyintake and referralsspecial projects and eventspolitical advocacyprofessional developmentoutreach and public educationproject design and deliveryPlacements begin in September and continue through to the end of April for approximately 400 hours. Students will often do this placement at emergency shelters, rape crisis centres, youth services, settlement agencies, health providers and other agencies who provide front-line support to survivors of gender-based violence.Field placement agencies are very similar to those employing our graduates. In many instances, employers hire graduates because of contact and experience with them through the fieldwork placement. Most agencies are within Toronto, while some agencies in the Greater Toronto Area and other locations in Ontario and Canada provide students with placement opportunities.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsAWCCA graduates work in a variety of settings, including:women\u2019s transition and interval housesrape crisis centrescommunity health centressettlement servicescommunity centresvictim/witness programsEducational PathwaysAWCCA graduates may apply for accelerated entry in the following related George Brown College programs:Social Service Worker (Accelerated) (C135)Child and Youth Care (Accelerated) (C153)Community Worker (Accelerated) (C131)Early Childhood Education (Accelerated) (C130)See\u00a0Transfer Guide.Graduates of the AWCCA program are also eligible to apply for advanced standing in degree programs such as:Justice Studies B.A. at Royal Roads UniversityProfessional Communications B.A. at Royal Roads UniversityBachelor of Social Work at Ryerson UniversityDisability Studies B.A. at Toronto Metropolitan University (part-time)Bachelor of Social Work at York UniversityAWCCA graduates can also apply to Women and Gender Studies, Environmental Sciences, Indigenous Studies and other programs at several universities such as York University, Toronto Metropolitan University, Athabasca University and University of Victoria.Future Study OptionsGraduates of the AWCCA program are also eligible to apply for advanced standing in degree programs such as:Justice Studies B.A. at Royal Roads UniversityProfessional Communications B.A.\u00a0at Royal Roads UniversityBachelor of Social Work\u00a0at\u00a0Toronto Metropolitan\u00a0UniversityDisability Studies B.A.\u00a0at Toronto Metropolitan University (part-time)Bachelor of Social Work (Honours)\u00a0at Trent UniversityBachelor of Social Work\u00a0at York UniversityStudents can also apply to Women and Gender Studies, Environmental Sciences, Indigenous Studies and other programs at several universities such Toronto Metropolitan\u00a0University, Athabasca University and University of Victoria.
