    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewStudy real-world solutions. Mechanical engineering is the cornerstone of sophisticated and technologically advanced economies. Process automation and control, precision machining and design functions can be found in industries as diverse as automotive, aerospace, robotics, biotechnology and energy. These mechanical functions open doors to a wide range of industrial automation and design-oriented careers.Full DescriptionDesigning the future, today. A solid grounding in engineering sciences and practical hands-on experience in mechanical and computer-assisted design labs provides the combination of applied and theoretical knowledge that employers require in today\u2019s integrated work environments.In the third year of the program, teams plan, fabricate and test their designs that require the application of all of the knowledge accumulated throughout the program. Once built, projects such as medical devices, entertainment equipment, solar-powered products and automotive accessories are often put on display and form an important part of the student assessment. More importantly, graduates learn to work in teams while solidifying their mechanical engineering knowledge and skills.Note: If you enrol in the program in January, you must complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year.Your Field Education OptionsField study in the form of industry-driven applied research projects are provided to students. Students work closely with their industry sponsors to design, fabricate and test a solution to a real-world problem.\u00a0Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities ",
