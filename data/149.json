    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewThis 2-year program is eligible for\u00a0a $40,000 scholarship.**Domestic students only - see page for details.This Electromechanical Engineering program will prepare you for the rapidly changing demands of the North American industrial environment. Today\u2019s companies require employees with multidisciplinary expertise that combines electrical, mechanical and controls engineering skills, along with the installation, maintenance and operation of increasingly sophisticated and automated equipment.  Full DescriptionRobotics, controls and process automation are cornerstones of modern production facilities and automated systems. Our multidisciplined and hands-on approach to learning culminates in a capstone project in which students design and produce a complex, integrated, fully functional electromechanical system by applying their accumulated theoretical and practical knowledge.Students complement their technical skills with a focus on the soft skills needed to establish a successful career and add value to any team. Students will learn from faculty who are experienced in both the workplace and the teaching environment.The industry-relevant curriculum is delivered through hands-on learning in the college\u2019s machine shops, electrical and industrial automation laboratories, process controls and robotics facilities, to ensure that graduates can move quickly and directly into the industry.Note: If you enrol in the program in January, you are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year to continue into semester 3 in the fall.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesYour CareerAs technology continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, graduates will be in high demand for their cross-disciplinary skills in all types of environments, including:automation and process controlmanufacturing and productionassembly and packagingbuilding and maintenance of automated systemspower generation and transportationsystems integrationtechnical salesquality control and other related fieldsSome of the college\u2019s industry partners, who have led the development of this program, come from sectors as diverse as automotive manufacturing, tunnelling and drilling, consumer packaging (including canning, bottling and imaging), food and beverage production, urban transit, power generation, and industrial equipment production and maintenance.Future Study OptionsOther opportunities can be explored through the\u00a0\u00a0Transfer Guide.
