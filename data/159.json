    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.Complete this comprehensive Robotics Technician training program using an interactive learning package. This certificate program introduces the concepts of industrial robots and explains how they are used in a plant or manufacturing system. The primary focus of the program is on automated manufacturing processes, as well as the role of robots and their support equipment. Receive instruction in both theoretical concepts and laboratory exercises using a combination of multimedia learning resources and a robotics simulation software package.Full DescriptionINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.The primary focus of the program is on automated manufacturing processes, as well as the role of robots and their support equipment. Learn to program, test and debug robot programs.Areas of study include:motion programmingpalletizingconveyor systemscomputer networkingautomated sorting systemsvision and tactile sensorscomputer integrationThis Distance Education program provides you with an easy-to-use, home-study approach that requires only a personal computer and an Internet connection; you do not need expensive books or lab equipment. The robotics simulation software essentially converts your computer into a virtual industrial robot, complete with a three-dimensional learning environment that includes manufacturing plants and control systems.The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format, with 14 courses (modules) contain text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing and RoboLogix simulation software.You may enrol in the program at any time (open enrolment). Complete each module (course) in your own time. The typical completion time is 28 weeks, but there are no time limits (and previous electronics and/or robotics/automation experience and education may reduce that time significantly).PREREQUISITESOntario Secondary School Diploma (with credits at or above the general level) or equivalent or mature student status. An electronics background is helpful but not essential.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThis program prepares you to install, service, maintain, troubleshoot and repair robots and automated production systems (mechanical and electrical). The skills acquired through this program enable you to work closely with designers, engineers and technologists, and to be involved in the developing, testing, programming and on-site installation of new robots. The training and knowledge you gain from this program will allow you to work as a robotics trainer and to train others to install, use and maintain robots. ",
