    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewThe Civil Engineering Technology advanced diploma program is a three-year program that focuses on the planning, design and construction of roads, bridges, tunnels, subdivisions, buildings, municipal services and heavy infrastructure. Students learn to ensure projects are functional, economical and meet standards and codes. There is a blend of lectures, laboratories and tutorials, with a focus on real drawing sets. There is an option for co-op.Full DescriptionThe Civil Engineering Technology advanced diploma program includes:\u00a0Designing reinforced concrete structures, storm, water and sanitary systems, roads and steel-framed structures.Interpreting construction drawings and specifications for various types of projects through extensive practical training from project drawing sets.Estimating, bidding, scheduling and managing/supervising projects using the latest software.Health and safety, site management and quality management on construction sites.Risk analysis and value analysis for construction projects.Types of contracts used by the construction industry as well as the legal aspects of construction.Business management techniques to pre-qualify projects based on expected returns, to create and manage a construction company and to understand the financial statements involved in running a construction business.*If you enrol in the program in January, you are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year in order to continue into semester 3 in the fall.Your Field Education OptionsStudents are encouraged to secure summer employment in the civil and construction sectors. This summer fieldwork reinforces and extends the classroom training.The Industry Liaison Office helps students connect with industry for field experience opportunities.\u00a0Co-op is offered after semester 5 to eligible students. Co-op placement term is 8\u201312 months. The students selected for co-op go for placement in the winter semester after completing semester 5 and do their semester 6 in the following winter semester when they return from their co-op.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsGraduates of the Civil Engineering Technology advanced diploma program will have developed skills related to the design, construction and maintenance of civil infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, tunnels, heavy industrial buildings, rail, and transit, storm, sanitary and water systems).Graduates of the program are prepared for employment in a wide variety of organizations such as government agencies (municipalities, Ministry of Transportation, Metrolinx, Infrastructure Ontario, etc.), contractors, sub-contractors, developers, engineering consulting firms, construction quality-control companies, cement and other construction materials manufacturing facility, aggregate quarries, surveying companies, concrete plants and asphalt plants. Roles within these firms may include:structural design assistantassistant site superintendentassistant project co-ordinatorproject planner/schedulerestimatorproject monitor\u00a0quality control technicianproject surveyor\u00a0municipal inspectorproject permits & approvals co-ordinatorconstruction claims specialistconstruction sales specialist\u00a0construction safety specialistquantity surveyorIndustryCanada's construction industry is essential to the construction and maintenance of residential and commercial buildings, as well as infrastructure projects such as highways, roads, bridges, tunnels, rail and transit, water supply, storm water management and waste water treatment. With many elements of Canada's infrastructure deteriorating, the federal government has announced plans to increase infrastructure spending in the coming years. This heightened support for new construction and rehabilitation projects will open up new opportunities for graduates in this field.Educational PathwaysQualified graduates are eligible to bridge into the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) (T317) degree program. For more information, see Diploma to Degree page. Additional future study options are available for individual graduates at various universities. ",
