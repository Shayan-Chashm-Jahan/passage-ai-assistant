The program provides a foundation for students to be agents for change in their work of community education, political action and law reform. It prepares students to provide anti-oppressive counselling for survivors who have experienced or are experiencing gender-based violence.This three-semester, accelerated program is suitable for graduates with an existing diploma or degree and work/volunteer experience in feminist organizations and programs, who are interested in working as a Counsellor/Advocate for survivors of gender-based violence.\u00a0PLEASE NOTE: If you apply to the 2023/24 intake for this program, you will begin your studies in May 2024.\u00a0 \u00a0Your Field Education OptionsField education plays an important role in this program by preparing students to work with those affected by gender-based violence, including the communities within which they live and work. This often includes those who identify as trans and non-binary, and other disenfranchised populations.In the fall of the accelerated program, students in field placement will engage in front line services such as one-on-one survivor counselling, group facilitation, case management and advocacy. Placements begin in September and continue through to the end of April for approximately 400 hours. Students will often do this placement at emergency shelters, rape crisis centres, youth services, health providers and other agencies who provide front-line support to survivors of gender-based violence.The agencies used by the program for field placements are very similar to those employing our graduates. In many instances, employers hire graduates because of contact and experience with them through the fieldwork placement. Most agencies are within Toronto, while some agencies, located in other communities such as Brampton, St. Catharines, London, Hamilton, Barrie, Pickering and Oshawa, provide students who live in those communities with placement opportunities.Note:\u00a0Some of our student placement partners require students in this program to have a vulnerable sector screening completed before their field placement in semesters 3 and 4 of the program. These screenings can take up to four months to be processed, are done to protect the clientele of these agencies, who are considered \u201cvulnerable persons\u201d under the law. The fees for the reference checks vary and are in most cases paid by the student. Students are responsible for ensuring that the check covers appropriateness for \u201cindividuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).\u201d Students who are unable to provide a clear screening will be assisted to find a placement that meets their learning needs.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesEducational PathwaysGraduates may apply for accelerated entry in the following related George Brown College programsSocial Service Worker (Accelerated) (C135)Child and Youth Care (Accelerated) (C153)Community Worker (Accelerated) (C131)Early Childhood Education (Accelerated) (C130)See\u00a0Transfer Guide.
