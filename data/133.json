Graduates of these diploma programs may be eligible to enter the third year of the degree upon successful completion of all of the bridge courses.The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program provides a curriculum that combines theory, applied research, field study and hands-on practical education. Recognizing that today's successful construction manager must possess both technical and managerial skills, the curriculum combines studies in construction engineering and technology with studies in business and management methods as applied to construction.Students obtain the knowledge and skills to manage the functions and processes of construction projects from start to finish. They master construction-related technical disciplines and soft skills that are critical to completing projects on time and within budget. Graduates of this program are entitled to the academic credential designation of Hons. B.Tech. (Construction Management).The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program is well recognized by the construction industry and is fully accredited by the Canadian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (CIQS).Graduates also qualify to obtain their Gold Seal Certification (GSC), offered by the Canadian Construction Association (CCA) to become certified superintendents, foremen, estimators, project managers, owner's construction managers and safety practitioners.Your Field Education OptionsFIELD EXPERIENCEAn integral component of the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program is a mandatory field experience semester offered in the spring/summer of the third year of the program. The field experience is jointly facilitated through the Angelo DelZotto School of Construction Management and the Centre for Construction and Engineering Technologies (CCET) Industry Liaison Office (ILO).Students are required to complete a minimum of 450 hours of appropriate field experience or the equivalent of verifiable past field experience, in the field of construction management in order to fulfill the field experience requirement.Students are allowed to complete the field experience through the following pathways:Field Experience course: Students register in the Field Experience course (TCOP 1001), secure a field experience opportunity in a construction management-related role, obtain a minimum of 450 hours of relevant fieldwork experience or equivalent and pass the course.Prior Learning Assessment Recognition (PLAR): Students who have prior field experience equivalent to the minimum requirement can seek to complete the Field Experience requirement of the program through the PLAR process.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThe Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program prepares graduates to assume leadership roles in all aspects of the construction industry.

Here's what sector leaders had to say about our program:\"The introduction of the Construction Management program at George Brown College is the next stage of development of professionalism in the construction industry. For the first time, the industry has its own degree-specific program which brings together the two most important elements identified by leading construction executives \u2013 the science of construction and the science of management.\"Temple Harris, vice-chairman, Gillam Group\"In order to provide the necessary leadership, we need to staff our projects with construction professionals. Therefore, we believe the four-year degree program in Construction Management at George Brown College is an important component to ensure our continual requirement for construction professionals will be met.\"Christopher Rick, PCL Constructors, Canada Inc.\"As the industry expands and continues to change, it is imperative that individuals overseeing and managing construction projects are properly trained in all facets of the business.\"James Zippel, general manager, Electrical Service & Projects, Ainsworth\"It is a fact that the construction industry is the largest employer in the Greater Toronto Area. Producing future graduates who already have the necessary construction-specific skills as they start their careers will only help strengthen the long-term success of our industry.\"Greg Kozicz, president, Alberici Constructors, Ltd.\"In our opinion, there continues to be a real need for improved and advanced education and training in the construction sector and an improved method of attracting and retaining the best and brightest of our future generations.
