    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewThis 2-year program is eligible for\u00a0a $40.000 scholarship.*This Mechanical Technician program integrates precision machining methods with advanced computer-controlled machine technology (CNC) in state-of-the-art Precision Machining, CAD/CAM, CNC, Research and Robotics Labs. Students design and manufacture tools, jigs, fixtures, precision fabrication assemblies and prototypes using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing software, precision machining equipment and sophisticated CNC machine tool technology. In their final year, students augment their learning by engaging in a 15-week co-op placement with industry partners.*Domestic students only \u2014 see page for details.Full DescriptionGraduates from this program benefit from a combination of advanced machine-tool technology principles (CAD/CAM/CNC) and extensive hands-on manufacturing practices that better prepare them for the technical challenges they may face in the workplace.In their final year, students engage in applied projects to design and fabricate prototypes using digital manufacturing technology (laser cutters, 3D printers, multi-axis CNC machine tools).All students will augment their technical training with courses in mathematics, communications and general education.Your Field Education OptionsStudents will complete a mandatory 15-week co-op term in Year 2 following the final semester of classroom studies.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsGraduates may find employment in areas such as:aerospacenucleartransit and OEM automotive parts companieshealth careconstruction and building industrieselectrical and electronics industriesmould-makingtool and die makinggeneral machiningCNC precision machining and tool-making industriesresearch, prototyping and development of new and existing productsIndustryThe tooling industry will continue to be the backbone for production, manufacturing and prototyping in industrial sectors such as:aerospace/aeronauticsmedicalmilitarypharmaceuticaltransportation/automotiveagricultural, mining, nuclear as well as emerging energy industries (solar, wind)tool and die makingmould makinggeneral machiningPrecision Machining, CAD/CAM, Digital Manufacturing and CNC technology covers the spectrum from traditional manufacturing to sophisticated high-speed, high-precision manufacturing that is required in the design and production of highly specialized equipment and machinery. In addition, these technologies play a vital role in research and development of new and existing products.The future of the tooling industry will depend on highly educated and highly skilled technicians, and our program provides graduates with a solid foundation and an advantage to succeed in this rapidly evolving industry.
