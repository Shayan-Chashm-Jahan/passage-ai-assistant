The program educates nurses to work with persons and communities of diverse backgrounds, ages, degrees of health and illness, and in a variety of contexts.The Bachelor of Science in Nursing curriculum, based on a philosophical foundation of phenomenology and critical social theory, has five themes that serve to organize content and are reflected in all years of the program in varying degrees of depth.These five themes are:primary health care/health promotionreflective practice/critical thinkingmeaningful relationships/caring/communicationpolitical/social justice \u00a0personal/professional developmentThe program is also underpinned by several important concepts, addressed, discussed, and threaded throughout the Professional Practice in Nursing courses that are required across all four years.These concepts include the following:safetyscholarshiprelational Practicedeterminants of healthdiversityprofessional nursing practiceleadershiphealth systemsteaching/learningThe curriculum is comprised of professional nursing courses and series of required and elective courses selected from other disciplines to enhance and support the broad knowledge base required of professional nurses. Students complete required professionally related courses in anatomy and physiology, microbiology, and psychology. Students are also required to select courses from a variety of liberal studies and open electives.Learning is characterized as an interactive, lifelong process that involves the development of the learner as a person. Nursing students are recognized as adult learners responsible for their own learning. This learning is fostered by a caring collaborative student-teacher relationship based on mutual trust and respect, where both students and teachers are learners.Year 1 and Year II \u2013 Studies to be completed at George Brown\u2019s Waterfront Campus Year I\u00a0of the program focuses on knowledge of self in the context of health.

There is an emphasis on the development of effective communication abilities, and foundational nursing practice and health assessment skills.In\u00a0Year II, the focus of the program shifts to knowledge of others in the context of illness, including chronic and acute illness and end-of-life care. Students further develop their professional role in building therapeutic relationships with families.

Students explore in depth issues related to professional practice and demonstrate leadership skills.Nursing practice experiences begin in the first year of the program and exposes students to a broad range of nursing practice settings and the multiplicity of nursing roles. Nursing experiences occur primarily in community settings and hospitals within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Travel to various agencies throughout the GTA is an expectation.Graduates of the George Brown College, Toronto Metropolitan University and Centennial College Collaborative Nursing Degree Program are eligible to write the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) registration examination (NCLEX) and accept entry-level positions in a variety of settings where nursing is practised.PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0Public Health continues to recommend that people working with vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0 Clinical agency partners continue to require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to be approved to complete clinical placements within their facilities.
