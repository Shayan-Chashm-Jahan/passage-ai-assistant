We support over 35 other Cisco Networking Academies in North America and are one of only a few academies that have an Instructor Trainer status.Program OverviewThe Computer Systems Technology online program is designed with extensive input from industry, and offers two optional specializations in its third year. The Networking specialization focuses on network security, voice-over-IP (VoIP) and wireless LANs. The Systems specialization focuses on mail server administration, content management systems (Collaboration), database administration and computer security. Both specializations include core courses on infrastructure virtualization (through the VMWare IT Academy) and cloud computing, along with best practices in Information Technology.This program is fully online, including lectures, exams and class projects. This fully online program allows you to:Study online from the comfort of home while joining other students across Canada in live, instructor-led classes.Access the knowledge and expertise of faculty members who are embedded in Toronto\u2019s rapidly growing tech industry.Develop professional skills in a format convenient to you and your busy weekday commitments.PLEASE NOTE: This is an online-only program, open to domestic students. Regular in-person delivery and International eligibility is available; please see Computer Systems Technology (T147) for more details.\u00a0Full DescriptionThe three-year Computer Systems Technology online program is designed with extensive industry input and offers two optional specializations in its third year:The Networking specialization focuses on network security, voice-over-IP (VoIP) and wireless LANs.The Systems specialization focuses on mail server administration, content management systems (Collaboration), database administration and computer security.Both specializations include core courses on infrastructure virtualization (through the VMWare IT Academy) and cloud computing, along with best practices in Information Technology (IT).George Brown College continues to invest in up-to-date networking, wireless, radio frequency, VoIP and security lab equipment, so that all students gain hands-on experience in installation and configuration of equipment ranging from small offices all the way to enterprise-class hardware and software. This investment, along with the hands-on teaching environment, was recognized by Cisco when the college was designated an Area Support Centre and Instructor Training Centre, and became part of a very select group of Cisco Networking Academies in Canada.In the third year of the program, students will be involved, hands-on, in real-life projects or case studies. These may be completed independently, in conjunction with an industry partner, or George Brown's Office of Research and Innovation, and may include developing proposals and working in teams to plan, set schedules and achieve specific goals in the field of information technology. Through some of these projects, George Brown students have recently helped develop IT solutions for hospitals, large corporations and major IT and telecommunications service providers, including Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications, Cogeco Data Systems and many other well-known companies in the Greater Toronto Area.This program covers all courses of the official Cisco CCNA Routing & Switching curriculum. The curriculum also prepares students to write several other examinations leading to industry certifications, such as the Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) and Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate.Note: Students who start the program in January (winter term) will be required to attend classes during the summer months (May to August).Technology RequirementsThis program requires students to have access to a personal computer with the following specifications:\u00a016 GB RAM minimum\u00a0256 GB SSD Hard Drive (500+ GB is optimal)\u00a0Quad-core i7 2.4GHz or better\u00a0Video card (2GB RAM minimum/4GB RAM recommended)\u00a0Webcam\u00a0Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThis program prepares graduates for jobs in a wide variety of positions, including:technical supportweb developerfield technician (wireless/cellular service providers)training service providersystem and network administratorcybersecurity analystsystems managerOpportunities also exist in companies that provide computer support services to other businesses, and in organizations that specialize in the sale and installation of computer systems and networks.Graduates may also find employment working directly with business clients, providing training services and ongoing support to assist them in using computer applications effectively.
