Your Field Education OptionsField placement plays an important role in this ECE (Accelerated) program as it provides a continuum of experience that gives students the opportunity to build on their learning as they develop skills and progress through the program.We approach teaching and learning in this program by alternating blocks of classroom theory with field practice. By providing regular intervals for students to apply the theoretical knowledge they are learning with practical, hands-on experience, it helps you build effective skills as an ECE practitioner and as a leader. Employers value this approach because it prepares our graduates to work as early childhood educators on day one.Our Early Childhood Education students complete a seven-week field placement in each semester of the program. During this time, students have the opportunity to work with children of different age groups in a variety of settings.To support student learning outcomes and ensure you have access to facilities that model the best practices we consider essential, we own and operate Ontario's largest network of school-run child care centres that serve over 1,100 children and their families each year. These 12 child care centres, located across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), will expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work and provide valuable services to the families and communities that they serve.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsGraduates of this ECE Diploma program may find employment in:child care centresearly years centresfull-day kindergartenparent resource centrespediatric playroomsspecial education settingsintegrated kindergartenstherapeutic nursery programsin-home careIndustrySuccessful completion of this ECE (Accelerated) Diploma program will make you eligible for entrance to Ontario's College of Early Childhood Educators\u00a0as a Registered Early Childhood Educator.\u00a0George Brown ECE graduates will:learn to design curriculum for child-centred, play-based learningsupport children\u2019s learning and development by responding to their unique needs and interestsbuild caring relationships with children, families and communitiescreate safe, healthy and inclusive early learning environmentsEducational PathwaysStudents who complete George Brown's Early Childhood Education Diploma program with a GPA of 2.50 or higher may apply to complete the bridge courses for entry into the third year of our Honours Bachelor of Early Childhood Leadership (Degree Completion) program.Your George Brown Early Childhood Education diploma will also give you credit toward degree programs at other institutions.For information on future study options, see Transfer Guide.
