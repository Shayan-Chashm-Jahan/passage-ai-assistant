    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.The PLC Technician II Certificate program introduces the theory behind Programmable Logic Controllers, while maintaining an emphasis on the application of PLCs in plant and manufacturing systems. The PLC Technician II provides a more advanced study of PLCs in manufacturing including DCS & SCADA systems. The PLCLogix 5000 simulator integrated within the program emulates the Studio 5000/RSLogix 5000 programming applications and features 3D simulation and advanced programming.ADVANCED STANDINGIf you have finished the PLC Technician program, you are exempted from 7 modules of the PLC Technician II program.Full DescriptionINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.The program material and PLC simulation software (PLCLogix 5000) used in this program are based on the Rockwell Logix 5000 PLC. PLCLogix 5000 is a Programmable Logic Controller simulator that emulates the operation of a ControlLogix controller and the Studio 5000/RSLogix 5000\u00a0programming applications. It is an ideal tool for learning the fundamentals of ladder logic programming with tag-based addressing.This distance education certificate program meets the needs of both employers who require a highly skilled technical workforce and students who require cost-effective, high-quality and accredited technical training.You complete all the required modules (including lab projects, review exercises and practice exams) from the comfort of your own home using an interactive learning package.The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format, with 19 courses (modules) contain text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing and PLCLogix 5000 simulation software.A final exam is taken online (computer-based testing) for each module. You may enrol in this distance education certificate program at any time (open-enrolment) and complete each module at your own pace. The typical completion time for this program is 32 weeks, but there are no time limits.PREREQUISITESOntario Secondary School Diploma (with credits at or above general level) or equivalent or mature student status.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThis certificate program prepares you to work in the rapidly expanding field of industrial automation and control. PLC technicians install and repair industrial electronic equipment, including I/O networks, data highways, variable speed drives and process control equipment, and write PLC programs for a wide variety of automated control systems, ranging from simple on-off control systems to robotics.PLC technicians also find employment in the industrial engineering field, where they are actively involved in the design and implementation of PLC control systems. This distance education program meets the needs of both employers who require a highly skilled technical workforce and students who require cost-effective, high-quality and fully accredited technical training.
