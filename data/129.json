This program, launched in partnership with the construction industry is designed to respond to emerging trends in construction management in Canada. In the increasingly specialized and complex construction industry, successfully managing a construction project now requires a multidisciplinary education in construction engineering as well as practical business and management methods. The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree prepares students for roles in the construction industry.\u00a0Full DescriptionThe Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program provides a curriculum that combines theory, applied research, field study and hands-on practical education. Recognizing that today\u2019s successful construction manager must possess both technical and managerial skills, the curriculum combines studies in construction engineering and technology with studies in business and management methods as applied to construction.Students obtain the knowledge and skills to manage the functions and processes of construction projects from start to finish. They master construction-related technical disciplines and soft skills that are critical to completing projects on time and within budget. Graduates of this program are entitled to the academic credential designation of Hons. B.Tech. (Construction Management).The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program is well recognized by the construction industry and is fully accredited by the Canadian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (CIQS).Graduates also qualify to obtain their Gold Seal Certification (GSC) offered by the Canadian Construction Association (CCA) to become certified superintendents, foremen, estimators, project managers, construction managers and safety practitioners.Your Field Education OptionsFIELD EXPERIENCEAn integral component of the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program is a mandatory field experience semester offered in the spring/summer of the third year of the program. The field experience is jointly facilitated through the Angelo DelZotto School of Construction Management and the Centre for Construction and Engineering Technologies (CCET) Industry Liaison Office (ILO).Students are required to complete a minimum of 450 hours of appropriate field experience or the equivalent of verifiable past field experience, in the field of construction management in order to fulfill the field experience requirement.Students are allowed to complete the field experience through the following pathways:Field Experience course: Students register in the Field Experience course (TCOP 1001), secure a field experience opportunity in a construction management-related role, obtain a minimum of 450 hours of relevant fieldwork experience or equivalent and pass the course.Prior Learning Assessment Recognition (PLAR): Students who have prior field experience equivalent to the minimum requirement can seek to complete the field experience requirement of the program through the PLAR process.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThe Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program prepares graduates to assume leadership roles in all aspects of the construction industry. Career options available to graduates of this program may include, but are not limited to, the following:construction managerproject managerproject coordinatorfield engineersite superintendentestimatorproject monitorbuilding science specialistbuilding condition assessorconstruction claims specialistconstruction quality control specialistconstruction health and safety specialistconstruction cost consultantdeveloperconstruction sales managerproject controls specialistsite inspectorcontractorsubcontractorCONSTRUCTION MANAGERS NEED SPECIALIZED SKILLS TO SUCCEEDIn this rapidly changing and growing industry, more and more highly trained construction managers are needed \u2013 managers who can effectively function within multidisciplinary teams of owners/developers, project managers, architects, engineers, planners, government authorities, contractors and trade contractors.

Here's what sector leaders had to say about our program:\u201cThe introduction of the new Construction Management program at George Brown College is the next stage of development of professionalism in the construction industry. For the first time, the industry has its own degree-specific program which brings together the two most important elements identified by leading construction executives \u2013 the science of construction and the science of management.\u201dTemple Harris, vice-chairman, Gillam Group\u201cIn order to provide the necessary leadership, we need to staff our projects with construction professionals. Therefore, we believe the four-year degree program in Construction Management at George Brown College is an important component to ensure our continual requirement for construction professionals will be met.\u201dChristopher Rick, PCL Constructors, Canada Inc.\u201cAs the industry expands and continues to change, it is imperative that individuals overseeing and managing construction projects are properly trained in all facets of the business.\u201dJames Zippel, General Manager, Electrical Service & Projects, Ainsworth\u201cIt is a fact that the construction industry is the largest employer in the Greater Toronto Area. Producing future graduates who already have the necessary construction-specific skills as they start their careers will only help strengthen the long-term success of our industry.\u201dGreg Kozicz, president, Alberici Constructors, Ltd.\u201cIn our opinion, there continues to be a real need for improved and advanced education and training in the construction sector and an improved method of attracting and retaining the best and brightest of our future generations. We submit that this program is a significant step in the right direction toward achieving these goals and believe that successful graduates of an effective four-year degree program will help to raise the bar in terms of the knowledge and capabilities of companies involved in the construction industry.\u201dMichael George, president, Trisura Insurance\u201cThe urgency for a program of this nature is fuelled by the rapid change in our construction industry and the fact that it is becoming more technology-driven each day. Having graduates of such competency enter the industry with refined skills on both the technical and managerial aspects of construction will not only fill a void that currently exists but bring immeasurable promise to the future of project managers, site superintendents and construction management in general.\u201dMike Van Volsen, operations manager, Access Suspended Platforms Inc.Educational PathwaysGraduates of the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program qualify to pursue graduate studies in relevant fields of study. They need to directly contact universities to explore what qualified graduate school opportunities exist.Some recent graduates have pursued further studies at the University of Waterloo, Columbia University, Toronto Metropolitan University and others.
