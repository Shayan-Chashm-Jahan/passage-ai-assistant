    "program description": "Program Description Leadership ClaimsGeorge Brown College was the first college in Toronto to offer the Behavioural Science Technology Advanced Diploma and spearheaded the development of the provincial Autism and Behavioural Science programs. This honours degree program is the latest evolution reflecting our leadership in the field.Program OverviewThis program is eligible for a $1000 entrance scholarship.George Brown College's Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis four-year degree program combines philosophy, methodology and theory with a strong applied learning component to create a comprehensive understanding of behavioural psychology and, more specifically, Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).  Full DescriptionGeorge Brown College's Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis four-year degree program takes an in-depth look at Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) \u2013 a field of study that uses a systematic and analytical approach to modify behaviour in a desirable way.We have been providing training and education in applied behaviour analysis in Toronto for more than 15 years. Our graduates are leaders of behavioural treatment in fields as varied as forensic mental health, autism spectrum disorder and acquired brain injury.ABA is an effective practice that is often used with populations who have:Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)brain injurydementiadevelopmental disabilitiesaddictionmental health disordersWhat you will be studying:Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour. This approach can be applied to the entire range of human behaviour (i.e., thoughts, feelings and actions). Research has shown that an evidence-based approach such as ABA is most effective at decreasing problem behaviour and developing a variety of skills.The ABA approach involves three main components:Component 1: A complete behavioural assessment is conducted. A variety of interview and observational techniques are used to gain an understanding of the behaviour to be changed. Students learn how to observe and analyze behaviour in a variety of situations in order to develop an effective treatment strategy.Component 2: The next step is to use the results of the behavioural assessment to develop an effective plan that will reduce specific problem behaviours and develop or strengthen cognitive and behavioural skills. Students will learn a variety of behavioural and cognitive behavioural techniques that can be used to change behaviour.Component 3: The final phase is an ongoing evaluation of components one and two. Students will learn how to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, and continue to refine and revise their interventions based on the results of these measures.RESEARCH COMPONENTA foundational aspect of this degree lies with the research component of the program. Students will begin preparing for this capstone project in years 1 and 2 through research preparatory courses. During the fall and winter semesters of year 3, students will learn how to prepare an applied research proposal. The actual research will be conducted during the fall semester of the fourth year. Students will receive faculty support throughout the entire process.ABAI VERIFIED COURSE SEQUENCEThe Association for Behavior Analysis International has verified the following courses toward the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst\u00ae examination. Applicants will need to meet additional eligibility requirements and demonstrate they can reside in an authorized country before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination.\u00a0View ABAI approved course sequence.The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) has published Verified Course Sequence pass rate data for 2020. This provides information on the percentage of first-time candidates who sat and passed the exam to become Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analysts (BCaBAs) from each Verified Course Sequence in this year.PREPARING FUTURE LEADERSIn addition to preparing students to be practicing behaviourists, the degree program helps prepare them to become leaders in this emerging field. Not only will students be supported in becoming client-centred clinicians, they will also have the opportunity to learn the skills to advance behaviour analysis from a system-wide perspective, to support large-scale changes in agencies, organizations and government.This intensive program, delivered on-site at George Brown\u2019s state-of-the-art Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences located at the Waterfront Campus, is suitable for students who are data-driven, enjoy analyzing patterns and like to work with challenging behaviours.The program\u2019s core courses are focused on five areas of learning:behavioural science theories, principles and methodsspecial populationspsychologyresearch methods/statisticsethics, professionalism and leadershipADVANCED-ENTRY OPTIONSStudents with a 3.0 GPA or higher, who meet one of the following requirements, are eligible to enter a summer (May-August) bridging pathway that leads into the third year (semester 5) of the Honours Bachelors of Behaviour Analysis (S303) degree program.any approved Ontario college behavioural science technician diploma program, ORGeorge Brown students who have successfully completed two years of the Behavioural Science Technology advanced diploma (C116) program, ORgraduates of George Brown\u2019s Behaviour Science Technician (C146) diploma programFor more details, please contact Program Co-ordinator Don Togade at Don.Togade@georgebrown.ca.External applicants from other institutions will be assessed for advanced standing on a case-by-case basis.Your Field Education OptionsWhile classroom theory is a very important part of your learning in this Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis program, we believe that field placement plays a critical role in solidifying that experience by letting you apply classroom theory to a real-world environment.You can expect to participate in block field placements in semesters 4 and 6. Between semesters 6 and 7 (between years three and four), you will complete one 14-week field experience term (unpaid) during which you will be expected to conduct a research thesis.Prior to starting the field experience term, a field co-ordinator will help students:explore their interestsprepare for interviewsfacilitate interview meetings by providing feedbackOnce students are in their placement settings, they will obtain support from the agency on-site supervisor as well as support from a college faculty field liaison.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsABA practitioners may find themselves in roles that include the following responsibilities:assessment of a client\u2019s skillsthe development and implementation of skill acquisition programsfunctional assessment of challenging behavioursbehaviour management plansdata collection and analysiscase managementTheir knowledge and skills are applicable to numerous opportunities, which may include such job titles as:Autism Spectrum Disorders consultantbehaviour technicianbehaviour therapistbehavioural consultantbehavioural specialistinstructor therapistrecreational therapistresidential support workertransition co-ordinatorvocational support workerEducational PathwaysGraduates of this Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis program have gone on to earn a master\u2019s degree at the following institutions in these related areas: applied behaviour analysis, applied disability studies, counselling psychology.Brock University \u2013 Applied Disability Studies\u00a0The Chicago School of Professional Psychology \u2013 Applied Behavior AnalysisMissouri State University \u2013 Applied Behavior AnalysisWestern University \u2013 Applied Behaviour AnalysisUniversity of British Columbia - Special EducationYorkville University \u2013 Master of Arts in Counselling Psychology\u00a0\u00a0Graduates of a health sciences program who have an interest in working in long-term care facilities should consider applying to our Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care (S417) postgraduate certificate.(S417) Program Details:two-semester programlearn to co-ordinate and manage a health-care team of interprofessional complex and long-term care professionalsdelivered online and on-demand to accommodate working professionalsincludes a clinical field placement component ",
