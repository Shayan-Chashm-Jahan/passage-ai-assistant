    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewThis Mechanical Techniques program is specifically designed to complement university engineering students' theoretical knowledge with applied practical techniques. Topics include manufacturing protocol, engineering drawing, solid modelling (Solidworks), precision machining, quality control, CNC machining with Mastercam, pneumatics/electro-pneumatic circuits and microprocessor control systems. Coursework emphasizes practical techniques through applied learning and hands-on lab activities.Full DescriptionThe Mechanical Techniques program is specifically designed to introduce currently enrolled and recently graduated university engineering students to practical engineering concepts that include:industrial safetydimensional inspectionmachining practicesmetal formingquality controlpneumatics/electro-pneumatic circuitsembedded electronicsComputer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining techniquesCoursework will cover both theoretical and practical concepts with a focus on the lab-based application of course content.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsUpon completion of the program, students will have a strong hands-on foundation in understanding the capabilities, limitations, applications and safe operation of machining tools and equipment.The skills attained through this fast-track certificate program relate directly to employer requirements for university engineering program theory to be complemented by hands-on skills.
