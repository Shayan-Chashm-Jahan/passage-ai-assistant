    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.The Programmable Logic Controllers Technician (PLC) Certificate program provides the basic technical skills and knowledge necessary to work with programmable logic control systems found typically in an industrial/manufacturing environment. The program covers the operation of various PLC control systems including both discrete and analog control devices. The simulation software, PLCLogix 500, which is included with the program, simulates the Rockwell Logix 500 series of PLCs.ADVANCED STANDINGIf you have finished the PLC Technician II program, you are exempted from 7 modules of the PLC Technician program.Full DescriptionINTERNATIONAL STUDENTSThis online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.Complete all aspects of the program while studying at home using an interactive learning package and receive a PLC Technician certificate. This innovative Distance Education program combines state-of-the-art PLC simulation with one of the biggest-selling PLC books in history.The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format, with 19 courses (modules) contain text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing and PLCLogix 500 simulation software.The interactive PLCLogix 500 simulation software essentially converts your computer into a virtual PLC and allows you to run, verify and debug ladder logic programs based on the Allen-Bradley RSLogix 500 format. PLCLogix 500 allows you to familiarize yourself with many different features associated with Allen-Bradley PLCs, including timers, counters, sequencers and math functions. Design ladder logic programs, perform tests and simulate the operation of real-world components, including motors, solenoid valves and a wide variety of other discrete and analog I/O devices.You may enrol at any time during the year (open enrolment) and complete the modules in the learning package at your own speed. The typical completion time is 32 weeks, but there are no time limits.PREREQUISITESOntario Secondary School Diploma (with credits at or above general level) or equivalent or mature student status.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsThis program prepares you to work in the rapidly expanding field of industrial automation and control. Automation in the industry is providing jobs for technically trained people who can build, program, integrate, service, maintain and operate PLCs. The PLC Technician program will provide the basic technical skills and knowledge necessary to work with electrical control systems typically found in an industrial environment.PLC technicians install and repair industrial electronic equipment, including I/O networks, data highways, variable speed drives and process control equipment, and write PLC programs for a wide variety of automated control systems, ranging from simple on-off control systems to robotics. PLC technicians also find employment in the industrial engineering field, where they are actively involved in the design and implementation of PLC control systems. ",
