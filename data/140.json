    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewThis three-year HVAC advanced diploma program will provide you with an understanding of the factors involved in designing, building, controlling and maintaining energy-efficient building environmental systems. The first two years of the program will give you practical skills through hands-on projects in the shops. You will be working on a wide range of furnaces, air conditioners, refrigeration equipment and other appliances in our labs. In the third year, there is an additional focus on commercial systems.Full DescriptionRising fuel costs, indoor air quality and climate change are all factors in raising awareness of the true cost of energy, and the need for energy-efficient building environmental system design, construction and maintenance.This HVAC program has been developed to address the current and future needs of the heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R) industry. In the first two years, you will study residential and some light commercial systems. In the third year, there is an additional focus on commercial systems.You will develop a firm understanding of the factors involved in designing, building, controlling and maintaining energy-efficient building environmental systems for a wide variety of requirements.The program covers the basics of air system and hydronic (water) system theory, required to design distribution systems and select appropriate fans, pumps, heating and cooling plants, and system controls for larger buildings.The program follows industry-standard design practices for environmentally responsible and energy-efficient residential, commercial and industrial systems, as established by the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute (HRAI), the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the Canada Green Building Council.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsOn successful completion of this program, students will have sufficient training to challenge the Gas Fitter 2 provincial qualification exam** and if successful (75 per cent passing grade) obtain the Gas Fitter 2 certification.As well, in the Building Code for HVAC (HVAC 2014) course delivered in semester 3, we assist students in preparing to challenge the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Housing HVAC House exam.* Individuals who are successful (75 per cent passing grade) can use this qualification towards obtaining their Building Code Identification Number (BCIN).***Please note that in addition to passing the HVAC House exam, there are further requirements to qualify for a Building Code Identification Number. For more information on the Building Code Identification Number, please visit the Ontario Building Code website.** The above-mentioned qualification exams are administered by the Province of Ontario. George Brown College is not responsible for the administration and/or marking of these exams.Successful graduates of this advanced diploma program may find employment opportunities in a broad range of disciplines within the industry, including:consulting engineering and architectural firmsdesign/build contractorsschool boardscommercial refrigeration installation and maintenance companiesbuilding automation and control companiesbuilding maintenanceHVAC/R manufacturing, sales and distribution companiesGraduates may also pursue management careers in the mechanical sector of the construction industry or opt to become self-employed specialty contractors.
