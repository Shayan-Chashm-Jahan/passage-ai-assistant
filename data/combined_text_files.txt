Admission Through GBC's EAP Program
Applicants from eligible countries who do not meet George Brown's English language requirements may be offered conditional admission to a post-secondary program through George Brown's EAP (English for Academic Purposes) program.

How do I get my admissions test result?
Results for admissions tests take approximately 5 business days to be issued. Please email your Admissions Officer 5 business days after you have written the test. Your Admissions Officer's contact information is on your Letter of Acceptance and Test Letter.

How long do I have to wait for my admissions test result?
Results for admissions test take approximately 5 business days to be issued.

What is the difference between the admissions test and the placement test?
Admissions tests are used to determine if you meet the requirements for admission to the College.

Placement Assessments in English and/or Math are taken after you have accepted an offer of admission. Placement assessments determine whether you are ready to take the college-level credit courses in English and/or math in the first semester, or if you need to take a foundation- level course first to further develop your skills. For programs that require English and/or Math placement testing, find out more from the Assessment Centre.

Note: If you have already taken an Admissions Assessment (as part of your college application process), your Admissions Assessment results will be used as placement results too.

How long is the processing time once I submit an application through the Online Application System (OAS)?
Due to the high volume of applications received, we are not able to provide exact processing times. Please note that we will not be reviewing applications/issuing offers until 6-7 months prior to the start of a selected term.

The processing time starts when we begin processing applications, not when we open the intake for submission. The current application processing time is approximately 3-4 weeks.

We do not have the capacity to admit all applicants who meet the minimum general and program-specific requirements. Please note that programs can close early if international enrollment for the program is already achieved and there is no more capacity. Submission of an application does not guarantee an offer of a place in a program.

The program I am interested in is closed, is there anything I can do?
Unfortunately, programs can close early if international enrollment for that program is already achieved and there are no more places. You can ask the International Centre or your admissions officer about other available programs or you may have to wait to apply for a future intake.

Protected Persons, Refugee Claimants, or Convention Refugees 
Protected Persons, Refugee Claimants, or Convention Refugees are required to obtain a study permit for engaging in education or training that is more than 6 months in duration.  Students must have a valid study permit in order to begin studying at George Brown College, if the program is more than 6 months and/or their intention is to study longer than 6 months. Details can be found by visiting Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada.

After receiving an offer of admission, you must apply for a study permit. Please note that Study Permits are not issued inside Canada. You must apply online or at the nearest Canadian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate. Official information on requirements can be obtained from an IRCC (formerly CIC) office in Canada, a Canadian Embassy or Consulate overseas and/or the IRCC (formerly CIC) website at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html

Applicants from eligible countries† who do not meet George Brown's English language entry requirements may be offered a conditional acceptance for College diploma, postgraduate and degree programs which will be subject to successful completion of level 8 or 9 of George Brown's English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program. 

† For applicants from some countries (e.g., countries where English is the first/official language and countries in South Asia) we are not able to provide the option of a Letter of Acceptance to the George Brown College English for Academic Purposes Program (EAP) as it has been our experience that Study Permit applicants from specific countries are rejected by the Canadian visa office for a Study Permit (visa) when there is an ESL (English as a Second Language) component requested. For applicants from South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) it is highly recommended to submit official TOEFL or IELTS scores.
