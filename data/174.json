    "program description": "Program Description Leadership ClaimsSupplying technical personnel for the prosthetic and orthotic profession for over 20 years.\u00a0This program is the only full-time technical training program in Canada.Program OverviewGeorge Brown College's Orthotic/Prosthetic Technician (S102) is a practice-oriented, hands-on program that teaches students to be competent with many hand tools and specialized machines used in the fabrication of orthotic and prosthetic devices. This program is unique in Canada.  Full Description  George Brown College's Orthotic/Prosthetic Technician is a practice-oriented, hands-on program that prepares individuals in the technical aspects of orthotic and prosthetic management. Students will learn to be competent in the use of many hand tools and specialized machines for the fabrication of orthotic and prosthetic devices.\u00a0This is a full-time program open only to thirty domestic students per intake, with classes starting every September.\u00a0(Winter and summer start options are not available.) It is taught at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre by faculty currently working in the field.To be considered, applications must be submitted to OntarioColleges.ca by February 1 of each year.The program has many unique activities that have become fixtures in the operation of the program. Since the inception of the program, it is mandatory for all second-year technical students to present a related topic in a formal setting. These \"Grand Rounds\" sessions occur once a month in the presence of faculty, students and professionals from the field.The program has a formalized Curriculum Committee which meets regularly and includes practising technicians and clinicians. The Curriculum Committee must ensure that the Orthotic-Prosthetic Technical program is responsive to and reflective of the most up to date technical theories in the profession.Over the course of two years, students will learn how to make the following devices to help rehabilitate individuals with disabilities:orthoses (braces and splints) prostheses (artificial limbs)New techniques, including additive design and manufacture (3D-printing), support the demand for technically competent people in this field.The orthotic/prosthetic technician makes prostheses and orthoses from technical specifications, measurements and positive plaster casts using a variety of materials, such as:thermosetting resinsthermoforming plasticsmetalfabricsleatherConsider applying to this program if you have:good hand skillsa strong background in math and human sciencesStatistical informationstudent intake: 30average no. of applicants: 150classes running per year: 2attrition (past five years): 20 per centemployment record over the past five years: approximately 85 per cent\u00a0Program Selection ProcessTo apply for the Orthotic/Prosthetic Technician program, a candidate must have at least the equivalent of an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) with the recommendation that applicants have credits in physics and biology, OR one can apply as a mature student.The selection of students involves a two-step procedure:i) Eligible applicants will be invited to take an online admissions test involving subjects covering English, physics, anatomy, and workshop awareness.Testing will be available on Saturday, March 4, 2023. Login window between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time). Applicants will have 90 minutes to complete the admissions test.Scheduling and arrangements for this testing will be done via the email applicants submitted when registering with Ontario Colleges.ii) The top ranked students from the admissions testing will be invited to an online video interview between\u00a0 Saturday, March 25 and Friday, March 31, 2023.Approximately 30 applicants are selected for the first-year class beginning in September of each calendar year.Address:Prosthetic-Orthotic Technician ProgramGeorge Brown College Prosthetic & Orthotic Programsc/o SCIL/U Wing2075 Bayview Ave.Toronto, Ontario, CANADAM4N 3M5Technical Program Selection Process Overview2023 Application Process:Online admissions test on Saturday, March 4, 2023, to login between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time).

Upon successful completion of these exams, Alumni are eligible to apply for professional registration with Orthotics Prosthetics Canada (formerly the \"Canadian Board of Certification\").Excellent employment opportunities are available across Canada in:hospitalsrehabilitation centresprivate facilitiesEducational PathwaysGraduates of this Orthotic/Prosthetic Technician program with a B.Sc. or equivalent degree who wish to continue their studies may qualify to apply to the Clinical Methods in Orthotics/Prosthetics (postgraduate) program. See the S407 Clinical Methods in Orthotics/Prosthetics program page for full admission requirements.The McMaster Rehabilitation Science (MSc) program is open to students of the Orthotics & Prosthetics Technician (S102) program who meet the entrance requirements for the MSc(RS) program, can apply to this concurrently or as a postgraduate.

Please visit the Transfer Guide for more information.This program is available to domestic applicants only.Special RequirementsAdditional Mandatory RequirementsPre-placement Health Form (for second-year students only)Second-year students must meet all the mandatory pre-placement health requirements for this program. It may take up to four months to complete all the requirements.All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.For further details and to download the mandatory pre-placement health form, go to the Pre-placement website.Police Vulnerable Sector Check (for second-year students only)In compliance with requests from our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a Police Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed annually before entering into field or clinical placement.The Police Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered \"vulnerable persons\" under the law.Students are responsible for ensuring that the police record check covers appropriateness for \"individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).\"Students are required to keep the original copy of their Police Vulnerable Sector Check.Students who are unable to provide a \"clear\" police reference check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a \"not clear\" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment.The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the Pre-placement website.Public Health recommends that people working with young children and other vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0 As such, students who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may not be able to complete the required field placement component of their program in the regularly scheduled time frame.How to ApplyDomestic students should apply through Ontario Colleges.
