    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewThe Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design is a four-year degree that produces designers who can solve problems using human-centred, socially conscious and economically viable digital solutions.Full DescriptionThe Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design is a four-year degree that produces designers who can solve problems using human-centred, socially conscious and economically viable digital solutions.In this program, you will develop the ability to critically analyze and adapt to ever-changing conditions of technology and culture. Foundational courses build your analytical, technical and business skills. In upper-year courses and capstone projects, you will collaborate on digital interfaces and applications, as well as interactive environments and objects.The curriculum focuses on three areas of learning based on the digital experience design process:Think: design thinking, theory, culture and research.\u00a0Make: designing, building and testing digital experiences.\u00a0Ship: entrepreneurship and the commercialization of digital products.\u00a0Digital experience design includes related fields such as service design, user experience design, and interaction design. It involves understanding human behaviour and human computer interaction, conducting research and usability studies, managing projects and working in teams, applying business skills, working with existing and emerging digital technologies, prototyping new ideas and anticipating future trends.Interactive Digital Media is a growing industry that is quickly changing, driven by shifts in consumer behaviour and technology. Graduates of this program will be able to contribute to and eventually lead interdisciplinary teams to solve problems across a variety of fields such as security, transportation, education and manufacturing. The degree also prepares you to pursue graduate studies in a wide range of academic disciplines.Pathway OptionsStudents currently in year two or three of George Brown College\u2019s existing three-year Interaction Design advanced diploma may be eligible for advanced entry into the Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design program.Following the Winter semester (January\u2013April), students who have successfully completed the second year of the George Brown College Interaction Design (G103/G113) advanced diploma with a GPA of 3.2 (75 per cent)\u00a0or higher, or have graduated from the program with a\u00a0GPA of 3.2 (75 per cent) or higher, will be eligible to complete a summer bridge program. Upon successful completion of the bridge, students will enter into semester 5 of the degree program in the Fall.Option A:Two years completed of Interaction Design.+ Bridge (three courses + two Liberal Studies electives)+ Two years of degree (18 courses plus 420 hours of co-op)= Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience DesignOption B:Three years completed of Interaction Design.+ Bridge (three courses + two Liberal Studies electives)+ Two years of degree (18 courses plus 420 hours of co-op)= Interaction Design and Development Advanced Diploma PLUS Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience DesignYour Field Education OptionsStudents must complete a 420-hour paid co-op work term in the spring/summer period between the third and fourth year.Students have the opportunity to complete this co-op domestically and/or internationally, as opportunities arise. The majority of co-op work terms are completed in the Greater Toronto Area, where the design sector is robust and the majority of interaction jobs are located.The School of Design Field Placement team works with many notable training partners, including agencies such as Publicis, K9 Strategy + Design, Trevor/Peter and Relish Interactive; larger, well-known brands such as Nelvana (Corus Entertainment), Rogers Media, Mozilla, Crayola and PUR Gum; and a variety of industry-relevant arts and design institutions, including the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD) and Applied Arts.The work term allows students to apply the skills, abilities and knowledge they've acquired in the program in a workplace environment or through an appropriate interaction design research project or initiative. Students gain valuable experience and the opportunity to reflect on the application of previous learning. A faculty member evaluates the student based on feedback provided by the employer.Students will develop a digital portfolio of design artifacts completed during the co-op work term.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsGraduates of this program will have acquired the skills necessary to be employed in design and digital media studios, creative labs, in-house design and digital departments within larger corporations across sectors, or to work independently or in a start-up.This program prepares graduates for positions such as:digital experience designeruser experience designeruser interface designerhuman interface designerinteraction designerinformation architectdigital designerdigital product designervisual designermobile designerweb designeruser experience researcherusability testerentrepreneurIndustryDigital Experience DesignDigital Experience Design embeds and influences human experience through novel and interactive forms of digital technology, combining hardware, software and design. The term \u201cexperience\u201d refers to the multifaceted interaction between humans and technology that respects the contextual and situational features of each. The future of digital design lies in understanding this interaction.Digital Experience Design is gaining currency in the field of research and practice. IDEO, a prominent global design consultancy, lists \u201cDigital Experiences\u201d as one of their core areas of expertise. IDEO sees \u201cDigital Experiences\u201d as those in which there are no boundaries among platforms. They use hardware, software, web and mobile elements, and interactive media to develop effective means for people to share, create and communicate. Thus, Digital Experience Design is a dynamic field, continually adapting to new technologies and interfaces, such as smart devices, sensors, adaptive architectures, mixed realities (AR/VR), immersive environments, multiscreen and multisensorial displays. Digital experience design is revolutionizing how organizations serve customers and how we interact with each other and the world around us.Interactive Digital Media (IDM)The Canadian Interactive Alliance defines interactive digital media companies as creators of \u201cdigital content and environments that provide users with a rich interactive experience \u2013 either with content itself or with other users \u2013 for the purposes of entertainment, information, or education, or that provides services that directly enable these products/services\u201d (2012 Canadian Interactive Industry Profile). IDM in Canada is a growing industry that is quickly changing, driven by shifts in consumer behaviour and technology. The comprehensive IDM sector includes companies that produce interactive content as well as firms that provide various types of products or services to enable the production of interactive content. These are sometimes called \u201ccore\u201d and \u201cperipheral\u201d IDM. Core IDM content includes but is not limited to video and mobile games, cross-platform entertainment, web series, e-learning and training products (Interactive Digital Media, OMDC).The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) leads North America in offering a diverse, talented pool of interactive digital media workers. The GTA has 15,000 technology companies employing more than 168,000 people, making Toronto Canada\u2019s largest technology hub and the third largest North American centre for technology firms, in addition to being the third largest centre for design on the continent.Educational PathwaysStudents currently in year two or three of George Brown College\u2019s existing three-year Interaction Design Advanced Diploma may be eligible for advanced entry into the Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design program.Following the winter semester (January\u2013April), students who have successfully completed the second year of the George Brown College Interaction Design (G103/G113) advanced diploma with a GPA of 3.2 (75 per cent)\u00a0or higher, or have graduated from the program with a\u00a0GPA of 3.2 (75 per cent) or higher, will be eligible to complete a Summer bridge program.
