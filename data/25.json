The term \u201cexperience\u201d refers to the multifaceted interaction between humans and technology that respects the contextual and situational features of each. The future of digital design lies in understanding this interaction.Digital Experience Design is gaining currency in the field of research and practice. IDEO, a prominent global design consultancy, lists \u201cDigital Experiences\u201d as one of their core areas of expertise. IDEO sees \u201cDigital Experiences\u201d as those in which there are no boundaries among platforms. They use hardware, software, web and mobile elements, and interactive media to develop effective means for people to share, create and communicate. Thus, Digital Experience Design is a dynamic field, continually adapting to new technologies and interfaces, such as smart devices, sensors, adaptive architectures, mixed realities (AR/VR), immersive environments, multiscreen and multisensorial displays. Digital experience design is revolutionizing how organizations serve customers and how we interact with each other and the world around us.Interactive Digital Media (IDM)The Canadian Interactive Alliance defines interactive digital media companies as creators of \u201cdigital content and environments that provide users with a rich interactive experience \u2013 either with content itself or with other users \u2013 for the purposes of entertainment, information, or education, or that provides services that directly enable these products/services\u201d (2012 Canadian Interactive Industry Profile). IDM in Canada is a growing industry that is quickly changing, driven by shifts in consumer behaviour and technology. The comprehensive IDM sector includes companies that produce interactive content as well as firms that provide various types of products or services to enable the production of interactive content. These are sometimes called \u201ccore\u201d and \u201cperipheral\u201d IDM. Core IDM content includes but is not limited to video and mobile games, cross-platform entertainment, web series, e-learning and training products (Interactive Digital Media, OMDC).The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) leads North America in offering a diverse, talented pool of interactive digital media workers. The GTA has 15,000 technology companies employing more than 168,000 people, making Toronto Canada\u2019s largest technology hub and the third-largest North American centre for technology firms, in addition to being the third-largest centre for design on the continent.Educational PathwaysGraduates of the Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design program may qualify to pursue further graduate studies in relevant program areas.
