    "program description": "Program Description Program OverviewGain expertise in advanced power and control systems. Our program was developed in collaboration with Toronto Hydro.Electromechanical Engineering Technology \u2013 Power and Control is designed to provide students with both theoretical and practical experience, enabling them to work in a wide variety of electrical engineering areas including power and control systems, utilities, industrial automation and robotics, instrumentation and process control. The curriculum incorporates theory, applications, practical experience and safety practices from power systems, utilities, manufacturing, control system, automation and computer industries, along with concepts from the sciences and humanities to ensure the graduate is equipped with technical knowledge, skills and practice.Full DescriptionGraduates of this program are able to meet the rapidly changing demands of industrial environments and advanced manufacturing industries through their ability to install, maintain, operate and troubleshoot increasingly sophisticated and automated equipment.In the first two years, students gain experience with both power and control systems including electric motors, controls, PLCs, generators, transformers, electrical CAD and electrical safety code. In the third year, students continue with courses in advanced power and control systems including electrical installations, power transmission and distribution, power quality, electrical protection and control, project management, automation systems and control applications.Graduating students perform technological functions related to:power and control systemsenergyrobotics and automationmanufacturingprocessingcomputer industriesThis work is primarily in support of research, technology installation, problem-solving, product development and design at a recognized technologist level.Your Field Education OptionsStudents will complete two mandatory co-op semesters.The first co-op experience takes place between semesters 4 and 5.The second co-op experience takes place between semesters 5 and 6.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsGraduating students perform technological functions related to:power and control systemsenergyrobotics and automationmanufacturingprocessingcomputer industriesThis work is primarily in support of research, technology installation, problem-solving, product development and design at a recognized technologist level.IndustryAs technology continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, graduates will be in high demand for their cross-disciplinary skills in types of environments including:utilitiespower generation and distributionrobotics and automationcomputer industrymanufacturing industryrenewable energyEducational PathwaysOther opportunities can be explored through the Transfer Guide at Transfer Guide.
