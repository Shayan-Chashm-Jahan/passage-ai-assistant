    "program description": "Program Description Leadership ClaimsGeorge Brown College was the first college in Toronto to offer the Behavioural Science Technology advanced diploma and spearheaded the development of the Provincial Autism and Behavioural Science programs.We have been providing training and education in Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) in Toronto for over 15 years.Program OverviewGeorge Brown College's Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis (S303) fast-track degree program stream is open to students who have successfully completed two years of an approved behavioural science technology or technician program. This five-semester program starts with a spring/summer bridging semester that leads into year three (or semester 5) of the four-year degree. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of behavioural psychology and, more specifically, Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).Full DescriptionGeorge Brown College's Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis (S303) fast-track degree program is open to students who have completed two years of George Brown\u2019s Behavioural Science Technology (C116) advanced diploma program or graduated from the Behavioural Science Technician (C146) diploma program. Students will complete a bridge semester during the spring/summer (semester 4) before joining the third year (semester 5) of the four-year degree program.The program takes an in-depth look at Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) \u2013 a field of study that uses a systematic and analytical approach to modify behaviour in a desirable way.ABA is an effective practice that is often used with populations who have:Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)brain injurydementiadevelopmental disabilitiesaddictionmental health disordersWhat you will be studying:Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) is a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour. This approach can be applied to the entire range of human behaviour (i.e., thoughts, feelings and actions). Research has shown that an evidence-based approach such as ABA is most effective at decreasing problem behaviour and developing a variety of skills.The ABA approach involves three main components:Component 1: A complete behavioural assessment is conducted. A variety of interview and observational techniques are used to gain an understanding of the behaviour to be changed. Students learn how to observe and analyze behaviour in a variety of situations in order to develop an effective treatment strategy.Component 2: The next step is to use the results of the behavioural assessment to develop an effective plan that will reduce specific problem behaviours and develop or strengthen cognitive and behavioural skills. Students will learn a variety of behavioural and cognitive behavioural techniques that can be used to change behaviour.Component 3: The final phase is an ongoing evaluation of components one and two. Students will learn how to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, and continue to refine and revise their interventions based on the results of these measures.RESEARCH COMPONENTA foundational aspect of this degree lies with the research component of the program. During semesters 5 and 6, students will learn how to prepare an applied research proposal. The actual research will be conducted during the Fall semester of fourth year. Students will receive faculty support throughout the entire process.ABAI VERIFIED COURSE SEQUENCEThe Association for Behavior Analysis International has verified the following courses toward the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst\u00ae examination. . Applicants will need to meet additional eligibility requirements and demonstrate they can reside in an authorized country before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination.\u00a0View ABAI approved course sequence.PREPARING FUTURE LEADERSIn addition to preparing students to be practising behaviourists, the degree program helps prepare them to become leaders in this emerging field. Not only will students be supported in becoming client-centred clinicians, they will also have the opportunity to learn the skills to advance behaviour analysis from a system-wide perspective, to support large-scale changes in agencies, organizations and government.Graduates of our Behavioural Science programs are leaders of behavioural treatment in fields as varied as forensic mental health, autism spectrum disorder and acquired brain injury.This intensive program, delivered on-site at George Brown's state-of-the-art Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences located at the Waterfront Campus, is suitable for students who are data-driven, enjoy analyzing patterns and like to work with challenging behaviours.The program's core courses are focused on five areas of learning:behavioural science theories, principles and methodsspecial populationspsychologyresearch methods/statisticsethics, professionalism and leadershipADVANCED-ENTRY OPTIONSGraduates of any approved Ontario college behavioural science technology advanced diploma program who earned a 3.0 GPA or higher are eligible to enter a bridging pathway that leads to the fourth year (semester 7) of the Honours Bachelors of Behaviour Analysis (S304) degree program.External applicants from other institutions will be assessed for advanced standing on a case-by-case basis.For more details, please contact Program Co-ordinator Don Togade at Don.Togade@georgebrown.ca.Please Note: This program is currently only available to domestic students, though current George Brown College International Students of C116 or C146 who wish to apply should contact Don Togade, program co-ordinator.Your Field Education OptionsWhile classroom theory is a very important part of your learning experience, we believe that field placement plays a critical role in solidifying that experience because it lets you practice your skills in a real-world environment.You can expect to participate in block field placement in semester 6.
