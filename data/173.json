    "program description": "Program Description Leadership ClaimsGeorge Brown College was the first college in Toronto to offer the Behavioural Science Technology advanced diploma and spearheaded the development of the Provincial Autism and Behavioural Science programs.We have been providing training and education in Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) in Toronto for nearly 20 years.Program OverviewGeorge Brown College's Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis (S304) accelerated degree program stream is open to students who have successfully completed a three-year advanced diploma in an approved behavioural science technology program. This three-semester program starts with a winter bridging semester that leads into year four (or semester 7) of the four-year honours degree. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of behavioural psychology and, more specifically, Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).Full DescriptionGeorge Brown College's Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis (S304) (Year 4 Bridge) is an accelerated degree program open to students who have completed an approved three-year advanced behavioural science technology program. Students will start with a bridge semester (January - April) that leads into Semester 7 (May - June). This is followed by an unpaid internship (September - December), and finishes with the final term, Semester 8 (January - April). Throughout the program, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of behavioural psychology and, more specifically, Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) is a field of study that uses a systematic and analytical approach to modify behaviour in a desirable way.ABA is an effective practice often used with populations who have:Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)brain injurydementiadevelopmental disabilitiesaddictionmental health disordersWhat you will be studying:Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour. This approach can be applied to the entire range of human behaviour (i.e., thoughts, feelings and actions). Research has shown that an evidence-based approach such as ABA is most effective at decreasing problem behaviour and developing a variety of skills.The ABA approach involves three main components:Component 1: A complete behavioural assessment is conducted. A variety of interview and observational techniques are used to gain an understanding of the behaviour to be changed. Students learn how to observe and analyze behaviour in a variety of situations in order to develop an effective treatment strategy.Component 2: The next step is to use the results of the behavioural assessment to develop an effective plan that will reduce specific problem behaviours and develop or strengthen cognitive and behavioural skills. Students will learn a variety of behavioural and cognitive behavioural techniques that can be used to change behaviour.Component 3: The final phase is an ongoing evaluation of components one and two. Students will learn how to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, and continue to refine and revise their interventions based on the results of these measures.RESEARCH COMPONENTA foundational aspect of this degree lies with the research component of the program. Students will prepare an Applied Research Proposal prior to conducting their research during the fall internship (September - December) and will be required to write a research thesis prior to graduating. Students will receive faculty support throughout the entire process.ABAI VERIFIED COURSE SEQUENCEThe Association for Behavior Analysis International has verified the following courses toward the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Behavior Analyst\u00ae or Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst\u00ae examination. Applicants will need to meet additional requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination. Please view ABAI approved course sequence here.PREPARING FUTURE LEADERSIn addition to preparing students to be practicing behaviourists, the degree program helps prepare them to become leaders in this emerging field. Not only will students be supported in becoming client-centred clinicians, they will also have the opportunity to learn the skills to advance behaviour analysis from a system-wide perspective, to support large-scale changes in agencies, organizations and government.Graduates of our Behavioural Science programs are leaders of behavioural treatment in fields as varied as forensic mental health, autism spectrum disorder, and acquired brain injury.This intensive program, delivered on-site at George Brown's state-of-the-art Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences located at the Waterfront Campus, is suitable for students who are data-driven, enjoy analyzing patterns and like to work with challenging behaviours.The program's core courses are focused on five areas of learning:behavioural science theories, principles and methodsspecial populationspsychologyresearch methods/statisticsethics, professionalism and leadershipYour Field Education OptionsWhile classroom theory is a very important part of your learning in this accelerated Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis program, we believe that field placement plays a critical role in solidifying that experience because it lets you practice your skills in a real-world environment.After successfully completing the bridging semester (January\u2013April) and semester 7 (May\u2013June), you will complete a 14-week field experience term (unpaid) in the fall, during which you will be expected to conduct a research thesis.Prior to starting the field experience term, a field co-ordinator will help students:explore their interestsprepare for interviewsfacilitate interview meetings by providing feedbackOnce students are in their placement settings, they will obtain support from the agency on-site supervisor as well as support from a college faculty field liaison.Career & Postgraduate Study OpportunitiesCareer OptionsABA practitioners may find themselves in roles that include the following responsibilities:assessment of a client's skillsthe development and implementation of skill acquisition programsfunctional assessment of challenging behavioursbehaviour management plansdata collection and analysiscase managementTheir knowledge and skills are applicable to numerous opportunities, which may include such job titles as:autism spectrum disorders consultantbehaviour technicianbehaviour therapistbehavioural consultantbehavioural specialistinstructor therapistrecreational therapistresidential support workertransition co-ordinatorvocational support workerEducational PathwaysGraduates of this accelerated Honours Bachelor of Behaviour Analysis program have gone on to earn a master\u2019s degree at the following institutions in these related areas: Applied Behaviour Analysis, Applied Disability Studies, Counselling Psychology.Brock University \u2013 Applied Disability Studies\u00a0The Chicago School of Professional Psychology \u2013 Applied Behavior AnalysisMissouri State University \u2013 Applied Behavior AnalysisWestern University \u2013 Applied Behaviour AnalysisUniversity of British Columbia \u2013 Special EducationYorkville University \u2013 Master of Arts in Counselling Psychology\u00a0\u00a0Graduates of a health sciences program who have an interest in working in long-term care facilities should consider applying to our\u00a0Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care (S417) postgraduate certificate.(S417) Program Details:two-semester programyou will learn to coordinate and manage an interprofessional healthcare team of complex and long-term care professionalsdelivered online and on-demand to accommodate working professionalsincludes a clinical field placement component ",
